# Cognifyz Technologies Data Science Internship Project

Welcome to the official repository for the Cognifyz Technologies Data Science Internship project. This project focuses on comprehensive Restaurant Data Analysis, aiming to uncover insights and build predictive models. Additionally, we leverage the power of Streamlit to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard, enhancing the data visualization experience.

## Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of restaurant data, exploring various aspects such as customer behavior, sales patterns, and operational efficiencies. Our goal is to extract actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions and foster growth in the competitive restaurant industry.
